              Have you ever struggled losing weight or just trying to be in shape? 
              My friends and I know that struggle all too well. We made this app to share our progress on a weight-loss journey.
              Those fad diets never worked for us or I. My name is Manny I'm gonna share a short story of my weight-loss journey.
              At the hieght of my weight of 272lbs. I was grossly over-weight, I suffered body dysmorphia and was overall depressed. Until a few of my friends got me out of bed. It took about 2 years to lose wieght. I had some major hurdles but I planned my Diet and Exercise around my needs. Not everyone is the same when it comes to diet, exercise, and weight loss. You have to build a lifestyle that's only for you. So in two years I went from 272lbs to 211lbs. You can say my doctor was estatic to see that. I learned what foods work and what exercises worked best for me. Overall its about you.

              I just wanted some help with weightloss. With the aid of my teammates, we innovated this Social Fitness App. We thought with other users/friends we can keep others and ourselves accountable. The journey is long, frustrating and demoralizing. I believe this app can help achieve our goals with friends. Teammates: (Dimi, Jake, and Manny)
